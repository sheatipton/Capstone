## Description
Fawn is an innovative app designed to connect users to nonprofits in their area, streamlining the donation process and making it easier, faster, and more effective for supporting those in need.

Fawn leverages AI photo recognition for item identification and reveals the greater potential of these features as AI technology improves.

**Note**: Fawn was originally created as an app concept for all nonprofits nationwide. However, the current state of the project only supports nonprofits in Athens, Georgia.
